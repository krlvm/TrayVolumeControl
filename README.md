# TrayVolumeControl

This project implements ability to scroll the volume icon from tray to regulate volume level from Windows 11.
It is also possible to middle click on the volume icon to toggle Mute mode.

[Visual C++ Redistributable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) is required.

This should work on Windows 7 and higher.
